# Computer Vision Metrics Project

This project aims to gather information on how metrics are defined and used for various computer vision tasks. The format for gathering this information is the **main.tex** file, where there are sections for each computer vision task. Each computer vision task section should have a description of the task, and subsections for each metric that is applicable to the task. Within each metric-applied-to-task metric subsection, there are four areas that should be covered:
- Metric definition and/or formula;
- Any further details, hyperparameters, processing steps, underspecification of the formula, context dependencies, or other ambiguities in the metric itself that can affect reproducibility;
- Typical range of values obtained with this metric on state-of-the-art systems for this particular task;
- Any other issues or subtleties that should be mentioned regarding this metric when applied to this task;

You can add as many metrics for each task as you feel necessary. Versioning will be done through git, so checkout a new branch, add your content, and make a pull request. Reviews and approvals will be handled primarily by Hamish Silverwood (@hsilver). Feel free to make comments or suggestions on other researcher's active pull requests, or to raise issues for discussions.
