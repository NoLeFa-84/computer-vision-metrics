\section{Introduction}
Here we present a number of tasks in computer vision and detail the metrics applicable to them. The tasks are organized into categories. Within each metric-applied-to-task there are four points that should be covered, as shown in the example in Section \ref{example_metric_applied_to_task}. Comments can be made using the \verb+\textcomment{}+ command like so: \textcomment{Comments can be used for ideas or references to papers.}

\subsection{Example CV Task} \label{example_cv_task}
